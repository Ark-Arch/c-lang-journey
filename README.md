my journey into c programming

This repository is a testament of my journey into the language.
I am hoping that by going through these 'some-what' simple programs, you are inspired to learn just like I was.

HAPPY LEARNING WITH ME!!!

p.s. I hope to document along the way concepts that I find important in achieving at least an 80% success in writing c programs.
